      <h2>Manga</h2>
      <p>
        Manga are comics or graphic novels originating from Japan. Most manga
        conform to a style developed in Japan in the late 19th century, and the
        form has a long history in earlier Japanese art.The term manga is used
        in Japan to refer to both comics and cartooning. Outside of Japan, the
        word is typically used to refer to comics originally published in the
        country. In Japan, people of all ages and walks of life read manga. The
        medium includes works in a broad range of genres: action, adventure,
        business and commerce, comedy, detective, drama, historical, horror,
        mystery, romance, science fiction and fantasy, erotica (hentai and
        ecchi), sports and games, and suspense, among others. Many manga are
        translated into other languages.
